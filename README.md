A simple project of tic tac toe.
It is done using p5.js and some jquery.
The game contains 4 bots : 
BOT 1 : Random bot that marks an empty position randomly using random function.
BOT 2 : This bot picks the first empty position and marks it.
BOT 3 : This bot is a heuristic bot, mostly hardcoded for certain scenarios, either wins or blocks other player. Techniques used for this bot can be easily found online, a strategy mentioned in wikihow page is very similar to the starttegy used here.
BOT 4 : This bot uses minimax algorithm with depth of 3 and makes the best move (requires some correction though, failing for some cases)
You can also choose to play against a bot or play with a friend.

UI requires some work, IF you have any ideas please comment, fork and request merge. Any suggestion, corrections etc are most welcome.
If you like this, please give the repository a star. 
Thanks!!
